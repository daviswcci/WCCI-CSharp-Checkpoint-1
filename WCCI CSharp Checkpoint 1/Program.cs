            // Create a comment below with your favorite pizza topping

            // Do the same, but with a multi-line comment

            // Declare a string variable named 'firstName'

            // Assign a value of "Davis" to 'firstName'

            // Declare a variable named 'lastName' and assign it a value of "Murphy" in one line

            // Using string concatenation, put 'firstName' and 'lastName' together, and assign the result to a new variable named 'fullName'

            // Declare two variables, 'wholeNumber' and 'decimalNumber' that have types fitting for their names. Assign both a value of 15.

            // Print out 'fullName' to the console.

            // Read a user's input from the console, and store the result of that response as a variable named 'response'. No leading question is needed.

            // Write an 'if' statement that prints out "That's a long response!" if the length of 'response' is greater than 15. Add an else statement that prints "What was that?" instead

            // Create a 'switch' statement that switches based on the user's input. Do this without creating an additional variable. (Hint: Coding is just substitution..). Then, create cases that print different messages.

            // Convert a user's input to an integer, and store that value in a variable called 'numberResponse'

            // Create a 'for' loop that loops 15 times, printing out the numbers 1-15 (or 0-14)

            //Create a variable called 'loopIndex' that has an initial value of 47. Then, create a 'while' loop that decrements 'loopIndex' and continues to run while 'loopIndex' is greater than 13

            // Use the decrement assignment operator to subtract 5 from 'loopIndex'

            // Create a boolean array of size 10 named 'numbers'

            // Assign the value of the 4th item in our array to be 'false' (Hint: Is 4 really 4?)

            // Print the 4th item in our array to the console

            // Create a variable named 'names' that is a string array of size 3 with the values "Davis", "Gavin", and "Carlos" (Hint: We can use {} to hard code those values... But how?)

            // Comment your response: Can we run 'Console.WriteLine(names[3])' ?

            // Create a list of strings called 'nameList'. 

            // Use the '.add()' method to put "Davis", "Gavin", and "Carlos" into the list

            // Create a foreach loop to print every item in 'nameList' to the user

            // Create a string dictionary called 'stringDict' that uses doubles as the key

            // Add "Davis" "Gavin" and "Carlos" to the dictionary with key values of 4.7, 1.3, and 9.9 respectively

        }
    }

    // In this file, create a new class called 'Kitchen' that has the following properties and methods:

    // Create a boolean called 'HasMilk', a string called 'Name' and an integer called 'Spatulas'

    //Create a public static method named 'Toast' that accepts a string called 'bread' as input. First, print the message "Toasting..." to the user. Then, check to see if the string has a value of "buttered". If it does, return "toast". If not, return "dry bread"

    // Create a public static method named 'Burn' that accepts a string called 'bread' as input. First, print the message "Toasting..." to the user.  Then print the message "Burnt." to the user, and return.

    // Back inside our Program's main method, run 'Toast("buttered")' and 'Burn("buttered")' 

    // Complete a hard sudoku puzzle
